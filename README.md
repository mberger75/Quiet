## What about it?

This is a web application (currently desktop only) to take a break and relax in the browser.
The idea is that you can select two options : music and theme.

Then, the landscape appears and the music starts playing. You can watch the video, listen to the sounds, listen to the music, listen to both or mute everything and just watch the landscape if you want... You can adjust the settings just like you want!
